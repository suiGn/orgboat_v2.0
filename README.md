            <div class="post-content">We’re tired of working dead-end jobs where we know we’re walking on eggshells every day. We developed&nbsp;<span class="subrayar2">OrgBoat&nbsp;</span>because <span class="subrayar2">we want to&nbsp;change the workplaces&nbsp;of America and of the world.</span>
              <br>Many of us have had too many positions where we just drag ourselves to work in the morning and felt like there was no way out;&nbsp;<span class="subrayar4">taxes taken out of our pay</span> at the highest bracket and getting paid according to the clock instead of according to our value.”
              <br>
              <br>As a&nbsp;<span class="subrayar">business owner</span>&nbsp;or even as a <span class="subrayar">Human Resource Director</span>, you create a universe; a universe with specific rules and regulations. You create the atmosphere where not only your employees are, but also where you are. You can make it something enjoyable and productive or horrible and full of terror.
              <br>
              <br>In this world we have a responsibility to make sure we have an economy.
              <br>An economy is built on industry and<span class="subrayar">&nbsp;industry is built of men and women with ideas.</span>&nbsp;It can only thrive where people are working and creating things with which to sell and deliver in a society.
              <br>
              <br><span class="subrayar2">We have a workable solution;</span>&nbsp;a solution that puts you in control and also gives your employees piece of mind.
              <br>
              <br>The demand of rise in wages is also met with&nbsp;<span class="subrayar4">a rise in taxes and inflation</span>.&nbsp;Employers are desperately looking for something to increase the efficiency of their workforce without them having to learn everything there is to know about how people tick.
              <br>Employees want a safe and sane place they can work, where they can come home to their families after a day of work and feel REFRESHED, not beaten to a bloody pulp. It’s time for a renaissance in the way people are treated and in the way workplaces are run.</div>
